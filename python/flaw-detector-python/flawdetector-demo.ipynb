It runs locally on the development node based on an Intel Xeon Scalable processor, where this Jupyter Notebook has a single core allocated to it. In other words, this demo is not running calculations on any of the edge compute node represented in the IoT DevCloud. To see how to employ the edge compute nodes, refer to other examples.\n",

    "**Note**: The close button on the video will stop the video, but the application will continue to run. To stop the anomaly detection application itself, interrupt the kernel. You can do this by going in the main menu to Kernel -> Interrupt."
