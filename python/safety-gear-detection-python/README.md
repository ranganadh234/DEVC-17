### Safety Gear Detection Sample

The Safety Gear Detection Sample is another demonstration of performing object detection in a industrial/safety use-case. The sample presents a video frame-by-frame to the Inference Engine (IE) which subsequently uses an optimized trained neural network, mobilenet-ssd, to detect people and their safety gear.
