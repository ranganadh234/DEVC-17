    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sample reference implementation to showcase object detection (safety gear in this case) with single-shot detection (SSD) and Async API.\n",
    "Async API improves the overall frame-rate of the application by not waiting for the inference to complete, continuing to do things on the host while inference accelerator is busy. \n",
    "Specifically, this code demonstrates two parallel inference requests by processing the current frame while the next input frame is being captured. This essentially hides the latency of frame capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of how it works\n",
    "At start-up the sample application reads the equivalent of command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. \n",
    "A job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Unit(VPU) or Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",
    "* Inference performed on edge hardware (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter Notebook)\n",
