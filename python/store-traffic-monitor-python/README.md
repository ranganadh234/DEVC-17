### Store Traffic Monitor

The Store Traffic Monitor builds on the two previous examples as an advanced use case. This reference sample show how a user can perform object detection and inference on multiple videos simultaneously. In this use case, the application monitors the activity of people inside and outside an imaginary store front and keeps track of product inventory using a pre-trained neural network for detection.
