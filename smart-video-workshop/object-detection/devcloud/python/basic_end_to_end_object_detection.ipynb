    "\n",
    "In a real-life inference application, the video processing pipeline may have these phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing (such as video decoding, frame capture from camera, or fetching a frame from a network, resizing, cropping, contrast normalization, etc.) The performance of this phase will often depend on the CPU, storage, and networking speed.\n",
    "2. Inference (running a neural network forward propagation procedure). The performance of inference depends mostly on the compute device (CPU or an accelerator).\n",
    "3. Postprocessing (feeding data into the next pipeline stage, writing to file, sending it to a database, or even encoding a new video for a human viewer). This phase will often use the CPU, storage, or network, and will not use an accelerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our demonstration samples, we separate these three phases into separate workloads. This separation allows you to independently judge the relative impact of each phase and draw conclusions for your applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does it mean for my application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your application may have more or less pre/post-processing work depending on how you get your data (from storage, sensor or network), what is the resolution of your raw data, is it encoded or not, whether you need to produce an output video, etc. Therefore, you need to understand how your processing pipeline relates to this demo before drawing conclusions on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we provide three performance numbers for each architecture. However, they are not hard limits on the solution's performance. You need to relate these numbers and code to what you are doing in your own project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The total time is not necessarily equal to the sum of the parts\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that in a real-life application, you may want to fuse preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing, as opposed to separating them as we did here. Fused preprocessing has several advantages:\n",
    "* If inference is run asynchronously on the accelerator, the rest of the system is free for preprocessing future frames or postprocessing past frames. This allows you to mask the pre/post processing time behind inference time. \n",
    "* With fused preprocessing, inference and postprocessing, your pipeline has better data locality, allowing you to reuse data in the caches, in the application's memory, or in the hard drive cache. "
